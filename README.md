## about me
- 🐚 Hi, _I’m @teworcapt_ 
* 🐠 I'm currently an second-year game-development college student, with a very large love for marine biology! 🎣
* 🐳 mainly am an artist but I've had a background with web design and javascript for 10-ish years.
* 🦀 Now, I'm a real sucker for c# because of game development! Recently trying to get back to pixel art and sprite making.
* 🍥 always craving something out of my budget.
* 🐟 Feel free to email me for anything really: _potatocchi@gmail.com_
